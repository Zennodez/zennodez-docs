As of Version 1.2.0, it includes 73 animations and 8 blendspaces of a female gunner character wielding a dual handgun setup. The functionalities are provided as a set of Actor Components , meant to be used on a third person character. The components can be added to an empty character as well as an existing one (such as the UE4 ThirdPersonCharacter from the ThirdPerson template) . The template supports easy swapping and replacement of the provided default animations with any custom animations that you may have. Thus, even if the default animations included are indeed made for a female character, they can actually be substituted for any type of character with minimal setup.

To speed things up, you can just copy all of the necessary inputs/actions that you want to use from the Event Graph and then paste it to your character. That will give your character all of the functionalities that is available in the demo However, if you wish to have a more detailed explanation on the nodes, the descriptions are included in the sections below. Once you've copied all the necessary actions, we will then proceed to preparing the animation system for your character . When using an existing character, make sure to do some extra check to ensure that the input events used by the character do not overlap with the ones provided by the template. Demo Nodes The nodes on the top-right area are used to provide functionalities for the demo. These includes, Toggle Demo UI Quit Game These nodes are not required for the Female Shooter template to function properly. They can be excluded if necessary. Camera Switcher Nodes On the area below the setup, you can see nodes used for the Camera Switcher. The Camera Switcher nodes are also not required, but might be useful if you need a smooth camera switching mechanism for your project. Details on how to use the Camera Switcher component can be found in the following article . Setup Nodes The content of the setup nodes can also be omitted depending on your requirements. If you do not wish to use them, you can either exclude them when you copy the template nodes, Or you simply deactivate them by unchecking their setup functions in the 'Begin Play and Tick' section. See the picture below for details. Female Shooter Nodes The nodes on the bottom area are the ones that are mainly required for the template. The list of inputs/actions available within these nodes includes, Character Movement (Gamepad) Used to move the character using the Left Thumbstick . Light press will make the character walk, strong press make the character run. Character Movement (Keyboard) Used to move the character using the keyboard. Default input is set to ASDW and handled by the KeyPresshandler component. The KeyPressHandler component is used here because the Female Shooter asset does not come with input registers on the project settings. Usage of this component is optional and is not required if you already register your inputs in the project settings. Walk Modifier (Keyboard) Used to activate walking mode from the keyboard. Walk is activated when the key is held down, deactivated when the key is released. Default input is set to Left Shift . Crouch Used to activate crouching. Crouch is activated when the key is held down, deactivated when the key is released. Crouch walk can be performed by moving the character while crouching. Default inputs are set to Left Ctrl , Left Alt , and Right Shoulder . Roll Used to perform rolling, can only be done when you're footed on the ground. Default inputs are set to E and Facebutton Right . Jump, Double Jump, and Somersault Used to trigger a jump action. Default inputs are set to Spacebar and Facebutton Bottom . There are 3 jump actions that can be performed depending on the context, If the character is on the ground, a normal jump will be performed. If the character is airborne and the parameter IsAllowSomersault is checked, this will tell the character to perform a somersault. By default, the somersault direction can be controlled using the Left Thumbstick . If no somersault direction is given, the character will perform a somersault to the direction of their current movement. If the character is airborne + parameter IsAllowSomersault is unchecked, the character will perform a double jump. Do make sure that the value of JumpMaxCount is set to higher than 1 to enable the double jump functionality. If you're not sure how to do this, see this article for instructions. Gun Equip/Unequip (Normal + Gunspin) (Keyboard) Used to toggle between equipping/unequipping the guns to the character's hands. Default input for the non-gunspin animation is set to 1 .

This step is required whether you plan to use the custom animations that you've already made or reuse the included default animations that the template provides. There are 2 ways to do this, You can reassign the skeleton for your skeletal mesh , (might not work on every mesh) Or you can retarget the Animation Blueprint to your skeletal mesh (recommended) Reassigning the Skeleton Reassigning skeleton is the faster way of the two, but it will not work on every skeletal mesh. The GunnerGirl_Skeleton is based on the rescaled version of UE4 Mannequin skeleton, so any skeletal mesh whose skeleton is based on the UE4 mannequin will most likely work with minimal issue when using this method. However, it's not really recommended to use this approach since it might not work with skeletal mesh whose joint orientation is set differently from the UE4 Mannequin. With that said, the steps are as follows, Right click on the skeletal mesh you wish to use for your character, Choose Skeleton, then choose Assign Skeleton A dialog window will appear, telling you to choose a skeleton. Choose the GunnerGirl_Skeleton, then press Accept. This will disassociate your mesh from its original skeleton, and set the GunnerGirl_Skeleton as your new skeleton. If you're using this reassignment method, the animation blueprint that you'll be using is located at Content/FemaleShooter/Asset/GunnerGirl/Anim/GunnerGirl_AnimBP . Once you're ready, you can continue with the process and see the next steps here . Retarget the Animation Blueprint Based on our experience, retargeting the animation blueprint to your existing skeleton seems to be the more reliable method to setup your animation system. It does take a little bit more time to perform, but this approach can be done on most skeletal mesh, even if the skeleton skeleton structure is not based on the UE4 Mannequin. The steps are written below, First, you will need prepare your skeleton for the retargeting process. Detailed instruction on how to do this can be found in the retargeting preparation guide . Next, navigate to Content/FemaleShooter/Asset/GunnerGirl/Anim There will be 2 Animation Blueprints on that folder GunnerGirl_AnimBP GunnerGirl_AnimBP_WithDefaultAnimations For now, we will proceed with retargeting both of these Animation Blueprints to your chosen skeletal mesh. Further explanation on this subject will be explained further below. Right click on both files, choose Retarget Anim Blueprints, then choose Duplicate Anim Blueprints and Retarget A dialog window will appear. You will need to choose the skeleton asset of your chosen skeletal mesh here. Try unchecking the Show Only Compatible Skeletons option if your skeleton asset is not listed on the option. [Optional] Add a prefix and assign the folder for the New Asset Name This step is optional, but recommended. It might be helpful when you need to locate the newly generated asset using its name. Press the Retarget button Previously, we choose both GunnerGirl_AnimBP and GunnerGirl_AnimBP_WithDefaultAnimations to be retargeted. This is done because starting from version 1.2.0, the Female Shooter template store each animations as a variable inside the Animation Blueprint. Due to this, when retargeting is performed only on GunnerGirl_AnimBP , only the Animation Blueprint will be retargeted, the default animations will not be included in the result. In the example above, both files are chosen to make sure that the default animations are also included when the retargeting is performed. Do note however, if you're planning to use your own custom animations with the Female Shooter template, retargeting only the GunnerGirl_AnimBP will be enough. Once you're done with the retargeting, we will proceed to the next steps . Connecting the Animation Blueprint to your Character Once the Animation Blueprint is ready, we can now apply it into the character. Steps are as follows, Open your character's blueprint Go to Components tab, select the Mesh component Go to Details tab, find the Mesh tab, Click on the Skeletal Mesh, make sure the value is set to your chosen skeletal mesh Next, still in the Details tab, find the Animation tab Set the value of Animation Mode to Use Animation Blueprint.

For this version, the shooting mechanism is animation controlled. User can call GunnerGirlComponent.Shoot to tell the system to start the dual shooting animation. The actual timing of when the shot is released is triggered by placing the following AnimNotify inside the character shooting animations: LeftGunShot AnimNotify RightGunShot AnimNotify GunShootUnavailable Tell the system to ignore any request to shoot the guns. To re-enable the shooting functionality, use the GunShootAvailable AnimNotify GunEquipped Tell the system to activate GunMode, this will enable the following settings: Switch the default animation from Idle to GunIdle. Enable Strafe Mode (character will always face towards the camera's forward direction). Dispatch GunnerGirlComponent.OnGunModeChanged event Dispatch GunnerGirlComponent.OnStrafeModeChanged event GunUnequipped Tell the system to deactivate GunMode, this will: Set the default animation to Idle instead of Gunidle Disable Strafe Mode (character will face whichever direction they are currently moving to) Dispatch GunnerGirlComponent.OnGunModeChanged event Dispatch GunnerGirlComponent.OnStrafeModeChanged event GunSpinStart Tell the Guns to start spinning, the spinning movement will continue until GunSpinStop is called. The gun spinning animation is performed independently from the character's animation. (the gun can spin on its own without the character doing any animations) GunSpinStop Tell the Guns to stop spinning, will only be performed if GunSpinStart was called previously. LeftGunShot Tell the system that the left gun just released a shot, this will: Automatically create a muzzle flash.

The following guide will explain how to switch the default animations of the template and replace it with your custom animations. The steps are as follows, Open your character's blueprint Select the GunnerGirlComponent Go to Details tab, find the Animations category There you will find a list of variables, either Animation Sequence or Blendspace, whose value can be modified. Assign your custom animations on each of the variables that you wish to replace.
